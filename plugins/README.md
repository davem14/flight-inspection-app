The plugins SimpleAD and MinCircAD communicate locally with an Anomaly-Detection-Server (ADserver).
therefore in order to use a Dll, ADserver must be activated **on linux environment** first.
The server can handle unlimited amount of clients, one client at a time, so there's no need of further activation.
Server is shut down by Ctrl + C.
